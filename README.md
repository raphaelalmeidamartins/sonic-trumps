## :page_with_curl: About

React project developed by [Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/) at the end of Unit 11 ([Front-end Development Module](https://github.com/raphaelalmeidamartins/trybe_exercicios/tree/main/2_Desenvolvimento-Front-end)) of Trybe's Web Development course. I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We had to develop a _Top Trumps_-style card game application by manipulating the components' states and props.

Special thanks to [Nibroc-Rock](https://www.deviantart.com/nibroc-rock) who allowed me to use his 3D artwork in the cards.

### Under development

- [ ] Fixing responsiveness in the Game tab (DualContainer component)
- [ ] Adding English translation (the project is currently only available in Brazilian Portuguese)
- [ ] I still need to implement how the Top Trump/Super Trunfo attribute influences the game.
